# Deploy DICOM Cast

In this quickstart, you will learn how to deploy DICOM Cast for your Medical Imaging Server for DICOM. DICOM Cast is a service which pushes Medical Imaging Server for DICOM metadata into a FHIR&trade; server to support integrated queries across clinical and imaging data. To learn more about the architecture of DICOM Cast, refer to the [DICOM Cast Concept](../concepts/dicom-cast.md).

DICOM Cast is deployed as an Azure Container Instance using the provided [ARM template](/converter/dicom-cast/samples/templates/default-azuredeploy.json).

## Prerequisites

* A deployed [Azure API for FHIR](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-api-for-fhir/) endpoint or [FHIR Server for Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server)
* A deployed [Medical Imaging Server for DICOM](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server)

## Deployment

If you have an Azure subscription, click the link below to deploy to Azure:

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fdcmcistorage.blob.core.windows.net%2Fcibuild%2Fdicom-cast%2Fdefault-azuredeploy.json" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
</a>

This will deploy the following resources to the specified resource group:

* Azure Container Instance
  + Used to run the DICOM Cast executable
  + The image used is specified via the `image` parameter and defaults to the latest CI build
  + A managed identity is also configured
* Application Insights
  + Used to log events and errors generated by the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM
  + If `deployApplicationInsights` is specified, an Application Insights instance is deployed for logging
* Storage Account
  + Used to keep track of the state of the service
* KeyVault
  + Used to store the storage connection string
  + Is accessed via the managed identity specified on ACI

Instructions for how to deploy an ARM template can be found in the following docs
* [Deploy via Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-portal)
* [Deploy via CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-cli)
* [Deploy via PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell)

## Authentication

The authentication used will depend on setup of your Medical Imaging Server for DICOM and your FHIR&trade; Server. For additional information regarding setting up authentication see [DICOM Cast authentication](/converter/dicom-cast/docs/authentication.md).

Below is an example of the settings need to be added to the KeyVault for OAuth2ClientCredential authentication:

* Add secrets related to Authentication in KeyVault for Medical Imaging Server for DICOM.
  + Example: If Medical Imaging Server for Azure was configured with `OAuth2ClientCredential`, below is the list of secrets that need to added to the KeyVault.
    - DicomWeb--Authentication--Enabled : True
    - DicomWeb--Authentication--AuthenticationType : OAuth2ClientCredential
    - DicomWeb--Authentication--OAuth2ClientCredential--TokenUri : ```<AAD tenant token uri>```
    - DicomWeb--Authentication--OAuth2ClientCredential--Resource : ```Application ID URI of the resource app```
    - DicomWeb--Authentication--OAuth2ClientCredential--Scope : ```Application ID URI of the resource app```
    - DicomWeb--Authentication--OAuth2ClientCredential--ClientId : ```Client Id of the client app```
    - DicomWeb--Authentication--OAuth2ClientCredential--ClientSecret : ```Client app secret```
* Add similar secrets to KeyVault for FHIR&trade; server.
* Stop and Start the Container, to pickup the new configurations.
